Patches staged for eventual merge to "official" repositories

This is a collection of patches for TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 provided by users.

Eventually, there will be full repositories for these OSs, and these patches will be reviewed for inclusion.

In the meantime, this serves as a common repository.

All patches are supplied by their authors, with no warranty.  Use at your own risk.

Although the patches are open source, use of these patches requires a valid
TOPS-10/TOPS-20 and/or layered product license.

Obtaining such a licence is your responsibility.

Most current users work under the DEC 36-bit hobbyist license.  
You are repsonsible for evaluating the terms of that license with
respect to contributing or using patches located here.

Patches that appear to contain licensing terms that would contradict the
36-bit hobbyist license may be rejected at the discretion of the project
owner.
